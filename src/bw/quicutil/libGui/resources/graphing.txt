** Graphing **


1 - Selecting Patches to Plot:

While holding left-shift, left-click on a patch.  When selected, a patch turns red and information will appear at the bottom of the screen.  You can select any number of patches.   Wireframe mode must be turned off.

2 - Graphing Selected Patches:

To plot the selected patches, right click while holding shift and select "Graph Selected" or press the G key.  To open the graph window and view the graph without regenerating it, go to "Graphing->Display."

3 - Changing Graph Settings:

Most of the settings can be changed in the graph settings menu.  To open this menu, go to "Graphing->Settings" in the top left of your screen.  For some changes you may have to remake the graph.
