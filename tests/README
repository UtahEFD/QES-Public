Add any special unit test or test programs.

compareSolvers will eventually compare the results of each solver type to determine if differences are within acceptable levels.

For now, if you want to run it, run it using -q and -s arguments you would use for qesWinds.
Specifying solver type won't do anything, but the argument is still required for the moment.
